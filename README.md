# Github Actions Learning 

- Create GitHub actions in your repo with the path `.github/workflows`. 

- Use the GitHub market place to find prebuilt actions and community actions. 
  - See the marketplace here [https://github.com/marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace)
  - We might use the `checkout` action to checkout code from the repo automatically.
